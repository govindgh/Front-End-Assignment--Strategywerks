## Products API used - https://fakestoreapi.com/products

## Design Pattern
Singleton
Product Service

## Code Brief

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) where there are 20 products(https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
Implemented products sorting and filtering using array filter
I've implemented pagination to load more products dynamically on scroll
On click of any product, it will open modal with additional details

Can improve more in responsive web design and user experience
